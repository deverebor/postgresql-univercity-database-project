## 📜 Sobre o banco

The theme given to our team was the model of work in the post pandemic
of covid. As a choice of database, we had PostgreSQL + pgAdmin 4. A
docker image was created to generate the database and its
dependencies, aiming at fairness in the environment among all the
team.

### 🪄 Storage Procedure and Views

In addition, Storage Procedures and Views were created to assist in
the search for data in the database.

- Storage Procedures:
  - Respondents who think about changing their work model.
  - Respondents working on more than one model.
- Views:
  -  Views to map the most searched countries.
  -  Views to map work time x experience.
